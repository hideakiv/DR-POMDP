Implements HSVI algorithm for POMDP and a DR-variant of HSVI for moment-based DR-POMDP.


## Prerequisites

Before you use the code, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have access of Gurobi. It is used as the optimization solver for various linear programming and models in the code.
